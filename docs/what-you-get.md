# What you get

## Words you will see

- **Repository** (repo): a project folder that git keeps the history of, usually also on GitHub.
- **Commit**: a saved snapshot of changes, with a message saying what changed.
- **Pull request** (PR): asking for your changes to be added to the main version, so others can
  review them first.
- **Hook**: a small script Claude Code runs by itself at a set moment, such as before every command.
  A hook can stop a command before it runs. You never start one yourself.
- **Skill**: written instructions Claude Code reads only when a task needs them.
- **Eval**: a check that runs the same way every time and gives a score, so a change that makes
  things worse shows up.
- **Terminal**: the app where you type commands. On a Mac it is called Terminal.

## Stops mistakes

- [`check-not-piped.sh`](../hooks/check-not-piped.sh): stops Claude from reporting failed tests as
  passed, which happens when the test output goes through another command.
- [`no-github-posts.sh`](../hooks/no-github-posts.sh): stops Claude from posting comments or reviews
  on GitHub, where they would appear under your name.
- [`one-draft-pr-per-repo.sh`](../hooks/one-draft-pr-per-repo.sh): stops Claude from opening a
  second draft PR in a repository where you already have one open, unless you asked to start a new
  issue, so a side change joins that PR.
- [`no-home-search.sh`](../hooks/no-home-search.sh): stops searches of your whole disk, which make
  the Mac ask you for permission folder after folder.
- [`cd-fall-through.sh`](../hooks/cd-fall-through.sh): stops a command from carrying on in the wrong
  folder when moving to the right one failed.
- [`no-foreground-wait.sh`](../hooks/no-foreground-wait.sh): stops Claude from checking over and
  over on a task it left running in the background, which keeps it from reading your messages for up
  to ten minutes.
- [`no-slow-binary-grep.sh`](../hooks/no-slow-binary-grep.sh): stops a search inside a large program
  file, such as Claude Code itself, that would run for minutes, and shows Claude a way that takes
  under a second.
- [`no-git-checkout.sh`](../hooks/no-git-checkout.sh): stops Claude from using `git checkout`, which
  can overwrite files by mistake, and names the `git switch` or `git restore` command instead.
- [`no-identity-override.sh`](../hooks/no-identity-override.sh): stops Claude from making up a git
  author, even in a throwaway test repository, and asks you before it changes the name or address
  your commits carry.
- [`calendar-free-busy-only.sh`](../hooks/calendar-free-busy-only.sh): stops Claude from reading
  other people's calendar events. It can still see when they are free.
- [`slack-user-search-own-workspace.sh`](../hooks/slack-user-search-own-workspace.sh): tells Claude
  that the Slack user search misses members of other companies who write in a shared channel, so it
  reads that channel instead of saying it cannot see their message.
- [`stop-running-stack.sh`](../hooks/stop-running-stack.sh): makes Claude stop the Docker containers
  it started before it finishes, so nothing keeps running and eating battery.
- [`stop-unreachable-claim.sh`](../hooks/stop-unreachable-claim.sh): sends Claude back to try the
  built-in browser, where you are signed in, before it says a page or file is out of reach.
- [`stack-held-by-peer.sh`](../hooks/stack-held-by-peer.sh): stops one Claude window from stopping
  Docker containers that another window is using.

## Keeps git tidy

- [`git-fetch-prune.sh`](../hooks/git-fetch-prune.sh): keeps Claude's picture of GitHub up to date,
  in the background, so it does not act on old information.
- [`git-fetch-before-remote-base.sh`](../hooks/git-fetch-before-remote-base.sh): fetches first and
  waits when Claude is about to branch, rebase or reset from the copy on GitHub, so it never starts
  from an old one.
- [`git-prune-gone-branches.sh`](../hooks/git-prune-gone-branches.sh): deletes old branches when no
  work would be lost, and lists the ones it kept.
- [`git-submodule-update-after-switch.sh`](../hooks/git-submodule-update-after-switch.sh): keeps
  submodules, repos inside a repo, in step after Claude switches branch.

## Keeps a record

- [`prompt-log.sh`](../hooks/prompt-log.sh): saves every prompt you type, on your computer only, so
  commits and pull requests can quote the prompts behind them.
- [`prompts-md.sh`](../hooks/prompts-md.sh): builds a `PROMPTS.md` file that lists those prompts per
  commit, like the one in this repo.
- [`prompts-md-current.sh`](../hooks/prompts-md-current.sh): stops a commit once when Claude did not
  rebuild that file for it, in a repository that keeps one.
- [`no-meta-prompts.sh`](../hooks/no-meta-prompts.sh): keeps prompts about Claude's own setup out of
  a project's history.
- [`abbreviations-listed.sh`](../hooks/abbreviations-listed.sh): holds back a commit whose quoted
  prompts use an abbreviation an earlier commit spelled out, such as pr for pull request, until the
  message spells it out too.
- [`usage-log.sh`](../hooks/usage-log.sh): writes down the tokens each turn used, so you can add up
  a week later.

## Keeps Claude to the rules

- [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md): the rules Claude follows in every project. It names no person or
  company, so you can copy it as it is.
- [`claude-md-changed.sh`](../hooks/claude-md-changed.sh): tells a running session when the rules or
  the pull request skill were changed in another window.
- [`permission-mode-changed.sh`](../hooks/permission-mode-changed.sh): tells a running session when
  you switched its permission mode, so it never names the old one.
- [`prompt-feedback-box.sh`](../hooks/prompt-feedback-box.sh): makes sure every reply to a prompt
  you typed ends with a short note on how your prompt could have been better.
- [`memory-plain-characters.sh`](../hooks/memory-plain-characters.sh): points out long dashes in
  Claude's memory notes, so Claude swaps them for plain punctuation.
- [`claude-md-memory-index.sh`](../hooks/claude-md-memory-index.sh): when Claude changes a rule in
  `CLAUDE.md`, shows it every memory note index, so it fixes the notes that still say the old thing.
- [`share-memories.sh`](../hooks/share-memories.sh): shares Claude's notes about a project with your
  team. It does nothing until you set it up.

## Extras

- [`settings.json`](../settings.json): turns the hooks on, picks my model, blocks a few tools,
  leaves "Co-Authored-By: Claude" off commits and keeps old sessions for 90 days instead of 30.
- [`mods/session-usage`](../mods/session-usage): a line under the prompt box that shows how many
  minutes the cache stays warm (a warm cache makes the next message cheaper) and how full Claude's
  memory of the chat is. The tokens and what they would cost show once a week instead, in the report
  of the last `/dream` run before the weekly reset.
- [`presence`](../presence/install.sh): my phone gets Claude's pushes, such as a question waiting
  for an answer, only while the Mac is locked.
  [`lock-listener.swift`](../presence/lock-listener.swift) keeps the file that
  `CLAUDE_CLIENT_PRESENCE_FILE` in `settings.json` names in step with the screen lock: it is there
  while the screen is unlocked, and Claude Code skips the push then. The desktop app pushes a
  session that no window shows even while you work in another one, so
  [`push-only-when-locked.sh`](../hooks/push-only-when-locked.sh) stops Claude's own pushes while
  the file is there. Mac only. This builds the listener and starts it at every login:
  ```zsh
  ~/.claude/presence/install.sh
  ```
- [`skills/commit-messages`](../skills/commit-messages/SKILL.md): how Claude writes a commit
  message: the order of its parts, the prompts behind the change, and what it leaves out or redacts.
- [`skills/pull-requests`](../skills/pull-requests/SKILL.md): how Claude writes a pull request: the
  description, the steps to test it, screenshots, and how it reviews one.
- [`skills/pull-requests/pane-upload.sh`](../skills/pull-requests/pane-upload.sh): puts screenshots
  into a pull request from the app's built-in browser, which cannot upload files itself.
- [`pane-bridge.mjs`](../hooks/pane-bridge.mjs): gets files from your computer into a site open in
  the app's built-in browser, through the site's own upload button, and saves what Claude draws
  there.
- [`skills/pull-requests/review-page`](../skills/pull-requests/review-page/build.py): turns a pull
  request's test steps and screenshots into a checklist page you tick off with the keyboard while
  you review it.
- [`skills/slack-draft`](../skills/slack-draft/SKILL.md): Claude drafts a Slack message and puts it
  on your clipboard with links and bold kept. You paste it and press send. Mac only.
- [`skills/dotclaude`](../skills/dotclaude/SKILL.md): how Claude keeps this copy and my own
  `~/.claude` the same, and what it must never publish here. Claude reads it only before it changes
  the setup, which keeps the rules every session reads shorter.
- [`workflows/dream.js`](../workflows/dream.js): type `/dream` when you stop for the day. Many
  agents read your recent sessions and your setup, and come back with suggested changes, each with a
  ready script. It changes nothing by itself and stops before your usage limits. When
  `~/.claude/dream/evals-checkout.txt` names a copy of this repository, it then reruns the
  [evals](evals.md) and publishes their numbers.
- [`agents/dream-worker.md`](../agents/dream-worker.md): a lighter agent for `/dream`, so it uses
  fewer tokens.

## Only for this repo

- [`sync.sh`](../sync.sh): keeps this copy and my own `~/.claude` the same, and checks that nothing
  private gets published. It also stops on a shell script with a syntax error, a file this list
  leaves out, or a line in `CLAUDE.md`, the pull request skill, the README or these docs wider than
  100 characters. `--install` copies everything onto a new computer.
- [`reflow.sh`](../reflow.sh): rewraps the paragraphs an edit changed in `CLAUDE.md`, the pull
  request skill, the README or these docs at 100 characters, in this copy and in `~/.claude`.
- [`test/dream-sim`](../test/dream-sim/): checks how `/dream` spends your usage. Not installed.
- [`test/hooks`](../test/hooks/checks.mjs): feeds every hook the input Claude Code sends it, in a
  throwaway home folder, and checks what it lets through. Not installed.
- [`test/rules`](../test/rules/adherence.mjs): counts how often Claude kept the rules in your own
  sessions of the last week. It prints counts only, never what was said.
- [`test/evals.mjs`](../test/evals.mjs): runs all of these and fills in [Evals](evals.md).

For the full details, open the file: every hook explains itself at the top, and so do `sync.sh` and
`dream.js`.
