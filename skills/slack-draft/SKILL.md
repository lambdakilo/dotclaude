# Slack drafts

Claude never sends a Slack message, as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` says. It drafts, and the user pastes
and sends. The CLAUDE.md rule on reading every source before drafting still holds.

## Why the clipboard

Slack's message box turns neither `[text](url)` nor `<url|text>` into a link. That syntax works only
through the API. By hand, link text gets in only by pasting a URL over selected text or by pasting
rich text, and bold, lists and blank lines also survive only a rich paste. Every draft therefore
goes on the clipboard as rich text, plain ones too, whatever the channel or DM, and the user sends
it with one paste.

## Steps

1. Write the draft as an HTML fragment in `~/.claude/drafts/<topic>.html`, with words separated
   by dashes, starting with `<meta charset="utf-8">`. Write it with a `cat` heredoc in Bash,
   never with the Write tool: the desktop app opens an HTML file the Write tool writes in the
   built-in browser pane, which a draft never does. The HTML only feeds the clipboard, so it
   stays out of `~/Downloads`, which is for files the user opens or sends. Use only what Slack
   keeps from a paste: `<p>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`, `<a href>`, `<ul>` or `<ol>` with `<li>`,
   `<blockquote>` and `<pre>`. A bold label opens each list item, unless the message being
   answered set a format: then the draft copies it, as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` says under Prose. A
   blank line, an empty `<p><br></p>`, goes between paragraphs and between a list and the text
   around it.
2. Link text belongs only in a channel shared with another organisation, such as a Slack Connect
   channel. Everywhere else a draft has no link text: a link it needs is its bare address, and the
   rest of this step does not apply. In a shared channel, link the evidence a claim rests on
   inline, on the words that make the claim, never in a parenthetical after them, and pinned so
   the link still shows what the text says later. An identifier the text names, such as a table,
   a route, a class, a file or a tag, is `<code>`, and a code thing it names, a page of an app
   included, links to the lines that define or serve it:
   - a commit cited for what it changed: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/commit/<full sha>`
     on its subject line, placed in the sentence ("commented out in commit <subject>"), never
     "(commit `abc1234`)". A commit named as a version keeps its short hash as code text.
   - lines of a file: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<full sha>/<path>#L<a>-L<b>`, with
     the sha of the commit that was read, never a branch name
   - a release: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/<tag>`, the tag as code text
   - a pull request or an issue: its full URL, never a bare `#123`
   - a Figma frame: `https://www.figma.com/design/<file key>/<slug>?node-id=<a>-<b>`
   - a Slack message: its permalink from the Slack connector

   Check each GitHub link with `gh api`, the `contents` endpoint with `?ref=<sha>` for a file,
   the `commits` endpoint for a commit and `releases/tags/<tag>` for a release. Never name a
   shell variable `path` in that loop: zsh ties it to `PATH`.
3. Run the copy script. It prints what it read back and exits non-zero when a type is missing.
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/slack-draft/copy-rich.sh ~/.claude/drafts/<topic>.html
   ```
4. In the reply, give no copy of the draft, neither a text block nor a quote: the user reads it
   in Slack after the paste. Say it is on the clipboard, say in a line what changed since the
   last version when there was one, and name each link the recipients may not be able to open,
   such as a private repository or a permalink from another workspace. Then the steps. The first
   is to paste with Cmd+V in Slack and check it before sending. It names the channel, and for a
   thread reply whose message it answers, in words only, with no link to the channel, the thread
   or a message: the user goes there in the Slack app. The second is the command that puts the
   draft back on the clipboard once something else overwrote it, with the draft's own file name
   in place of `<topic>`:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/slack-draft/copy-rich.sh ~/.claude/drafts/<topic>.html
   ```

## What does not work

- AppleScript's `set the clipboard to` with HTML data writes HTML alone, and most paste targets
  then find nothing.
- A paste into Slack from the browser pane tests nothing: a synthetic Cmd+V does not reach the
  system clipboard and Slack ignores synthetic paste events. The script's read-back is the check,
  and the user's paste is the real test.
- The script needs macOS: `textutil` and `NSPasteboard`.
