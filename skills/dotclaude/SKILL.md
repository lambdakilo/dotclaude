description: How the public mirror of ~/.claude works. Load it before changing ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, settings.json, a hook, a mirrored skill, a mod, a workflow or the presence listener, before adding a hook, skill, command or agent under ~/.claude, before changing anything in ~/Projects/dotclaude or a directory it mirrors into, and when setting up a new machine. It covers sync.sh with its scan and mirrors, the commit and its identity, the pass over open PRs after every push, and what the repository may contain.

# Public configuration repository

These procedures sit beside the Public configuration repository rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
which still hold: the user's go before a change to that file or a mirrored skill, the `sync.sh` run
and its commit in the same turn, and the rule that a mirrored file states what holds now.

## The checkout

- The checkout at `~/Projects/dotclaude` holds the mirrored files, each named in the `mirrored` list
  of `sync.sh`, and its own `README.md`, `docs/`, licence texts and `sync.sh`.
- The mirrored copy keeps the name `CLAUDE.md`. A session started inside the checkout would load it
  as project memory on top of the global file, so `settings.json` lists `**/dotclaude/CLAUDE.md` in
  `claudeMdExcludes`. Claude Code reads no other mirrored file from a repository root, so nothing
  else needs a different name.
- When a new file under `~/.claude` would help other people (a hook, a skill, a command, an agent),
  add it to the list in `sync.sh` first and give it an entry in the checkout's
  `docs/what-you-get.md`. The `README.md` stays one screen long: it says what the repository is,
  shows its parts and links the docs.

## sync.sh

- `sync.sh` pulls the checkout fast-forward, then reconciles each mirrored file: one the pull
  changed is installed into `~/.claude`, one changed locally is copied into the checkout, and one
  changed on both sides stops the run for a manual merge. It then scans everything that would be
  published for the local user name, home paths, the git identity, email addresses and
  credential-shaped strings, exits non-zero on a hit, and prints `git status`. Literals listed one
  per line in `sync-allow.txt`, when that file exists, are exempt. Literals listed one per line in
  the git-ignored `sync-deny.txt` fail the scan in any case, and `sync.sh --check-message`, run from
  the untracked commit-msg hook of the checkout and of each mirror, holds commit messages to the
  same list, less the literals that `sync-deny-skip.txt` in that repository's git directory lists,
  such as an employer's name in a repository the employer owns.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, the files under `docs/` and the pull-requests skill wrap prose at 100
  columns, a list item's later lines indented under its text, and a plain `sync.sh` run stops on a
  longer line. After an edit of one of them, run `~/Projects/dotclaude/reflow.sh` bare in place of a
  reflow written for the edit, as a command of its own rather than chained with `sync.sh`, so the
  hook that watches `CLAUDE.md` counts the change as the session's own edit. It fills greedily each
  paragraph that differs from the checkout's last commit, in `~/.claude` and in the checkout, from
  the line before the first change, and leaves the other paragraphs as they are.
- `sync.sh` holds `CLAUDE.md` to the byte count in the checkout's `claude-md-budget.txt`: over it, a
  run lists the file's sections by size and `--commit` refuses `CLAUDE.md`. Before cutting anything,
  ask through AskUserQuestion whether to cut a block at least as large as the overage, or move it
  into the skill that covers its subject, naming the block and recommending it, or to raise the
  budget. Either way, and after any other change that shrinks the file, write its new size rounded
  up to the next 1,000 into `claude-md-budget.txt` and commit that file too, so the budget falls
  with every cut and rises only on the user's yes.
- `sync.sh --commit <file> <path>...` commits the named paths and pushes them to the default branch,
  then every mirror below. It refuses a run that names no path, or no path with a change. No PR: the
  repository has one owner, though several sessions work in the checkout at once, and every
  `sync.sh` run copies their edits into it too. So name only the files this session's own edits
  touched, never what a `git status` taken around them shows, and right before the commit read
  `git -C ~/Projects/dotclaude diff -- <path>...`: a hunk this session did not write is another
  session's, so leave its file out and tell that session with SendMessage, or wait for its commit
  when the file holds a change of this session's too. A mirrored JSON file changed locally goes back
  into the checkout's key order first, so `claude plugin` and the `/plugin` dialog may change
  `settings.json`.
- `sync.sh` also copies every published file into each directory listed in `sync-mirrors.txt`, an
  optional file beside it that git ignores, removes there what the checkout has deleted, and prints
  each directory it copied into. With `--commit` it then commits and pushes in each of them with the
  same message and a line naming the checkout commit, so one message is trimmed and redacted for
  every copy. Which directories those are and what each is for lives in the dotclaude checkout's
  project memory, never in this skill, in `CLAUDE.md` or in another tracked file, so the public
  repository shows the mechanism and nothing it points at.
- A file under `~/.claude` that names a project, client or person can still reach the mirrors:
  `sync-private.txt`, beside `sync.sh` and ignored by git, lists such files one per line, and
  `sync.sh` copies each from `~/.claude` into every mirror, never into the checkout, scanning it
  for credentials alone. Named after `--commit`, they are committed in the mirrors only, and a run
  that names no other changed path commits nothing in the checkout. The mirrors' commit-msg hook
  still checks the deny list, so the message names such a file by what it does. A file that no
  copy may hold, such as one with a contract's figures, stays off the list. Which files the list
  names lives in the checkout's project memory, and each of them ends by saying it is mirrored.

## After a push

- Every push to the checkout is followed in the same turn by a pass over the user's open PRs,
  listed with `gh search prs --author @me --state open`. Each PR whose body carries a block the
  `pull-requests` skill puts there, the configuration link or the prompts block, gets the link
  pinned to the commit just pushed and the rest of the body brought into line with the rules as they
  now stand, as far as the skill lets an edit of the body change it. A PR with neither block was
  written by hand and stays as it is. Nothing is rebuilt from another session's context: what the
  new rules need beyond the body, such as prompts, a verify run or new screenshots, is named in the
  reply under its PR, next to what the edit changed. `sync.sh --commit` ends by listing the open PRs
  whose body links the repository but not the commit it just pushed. It is a safety net for the
  pass, not a substitute for it: a PR with only the prompts block is not on that list.

## Identity and contents

- Commits there carry the identity configured in the checkout, and the rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  about never overriding the git author applies to it as it stands: the user's own name with a
  disposable address.
- That repository never contains another person's name, an employer, client or customer name, a
  project name, a secret, or anything else that discloses what the user works on. The user's own
  name may stand in the history, as the author or in a quoted prompt, but in no published file,
  which the scan enforces. No email address either: the disposable address lives in the checkout's
  git config and nowhere else. Redact quoted prompts with square brackets where needed, as for
  upstream PRs, and quote only the part of a prompt that is about the configuration, as the
  `commit-messages` skill says; the mirrors follow the same rule. An example in a
  published file is a generic English placeholder, never a label, address, number or tool name from
  the session's project or employer, and a term that slips through goes into `sync-deny.txt`.

## New machine

- Follow the checkout's `docs/install.md`, taking everything (option b), then its identity step
  before the first commit, with the name and address `git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'` prints for
  the existing history.
