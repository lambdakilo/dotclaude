# Claude Code Stop hook. When the turn's closing message says in the first
# person that Claude could not open, read, reach, access, view, download,
# upload, attach, load, find, get, fetch or list something, and no built-in
# browser pane tool ran since the prompt, it sends the turn back once, so
# the pane is tried or the reply says why it cannot help. A session whose
# transcript never names the pane's tools passes. The phrase list is a
# heuristic and English only. The turn is read from the transcript, whose
# format Claude Code does not document, so a change there makes this hook
# quietly pass.
