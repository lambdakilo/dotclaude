# the marker file that CLAUDE_CLIENT_PRESENCE_FILE names exists, which the
# presence listener keeps there while the Mac's screen is unlocked. Claude
# Code's own presence check covers only sessions bridged from the terminal, and
# the desktop app sends a session's push to the phone whenever no window shows
# that session, also while the user works in another one.
