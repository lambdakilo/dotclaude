# dotclaude

My Claude Code setup, the `~/.claude` folder, made public so you can borrow from it. Most of it
stops a mistake Claude Code makes again and again before it happens. Projects that write their code
with AI should publish how they used it too, so every commit here quotes the prompts behind it,
collected in [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md).

| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | [`hooks/`](hooks) | [`skills/`](skills) | [`workflows/`](workflows/dream.js) | [`mods/`](mods/session-usage) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the rules Claude follows in every project | stop mistakes, keep git tidy, keep a record | pull requests, Slack drafts, this copy | `/dream`, an idle-time review that proposes changes | cache and context gauge under the prompt |

**Docs:** [what you get](docs/what-you-get.md), [how I work](docs/how-i-work.md),
[evals](docs/evals.md), [install](docs/install.md).
